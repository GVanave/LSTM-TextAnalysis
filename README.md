# Text Classification and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains projects related to text classification and sentiment analysis using machine learning and deep learning techniques. It includes the following projects:

## Email Spam Detection (Random Forest Model)

### Description
In this project, we implemented a Random Forest model to classify emails as spam or not spam (ham).

### Usage
- **Data Preparation**: The dataset used for training and testing.
- **Preprocessing**: Steps taken to clean and prepare the text data.
- **Feature Extraction**: Methods used for converting text data into numerical features.
- **Model Training**: How the Random Forest model was trained.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluation metrics used to assess the model's performance.


## Text Classification with LSTM

### Description
This project focuses on text classification using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of deep learning model.

### Usage
- **Data Preparation**: Details about the dataset used.
- **Preprocessing**: Text preprocessing steps applied to the data.
- **Model Architecture**: Information about the LSTM-based model.
- **Training**: How the model was trained.
- **Evaluation**: Metrics used to assess the model's performance.

## Twitter Sentiment Analysis

### Description
This project performs sentiment analysis on Twitter data to understand the sentiment of text data.

### Usage
